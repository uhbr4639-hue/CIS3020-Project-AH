        <h3>On this page, I'll be explaining the basics of investing. If you haven't check out the key terms page or the quiz on it yet, I'd highly recommend that you do so, as I'll be assuming you already understand those terms. Now, let's get started.</h3>
		<h3>A financial investment is essentially dedicating money to assets like bonds, stocks, etc. The goal of investments are to make more money than you put into the investment. Most investments come with an inherent risk, however big or small it may be. You gain value from these invesments by your assets appreciating in value or from other conditional benefits that come with the investments, like dividends. Investments will always come with potential of risks because the economy simply wouldn't function if every investment was guaranteed to make more money back. This is why it's always important to consider investments wisely and not commit to one unless you know what you're doing. To recap, the important difference between saving and investing is that saving has no real risk but doesn't have much potential to gain money, while investments come with risks but have potential for high returns.</h3>

		<h2>Risks and Risk Aversion</h2>
		<h3>As stated, investments come with risks. That risk generally depends on how big the potential returns are. (Higher Risk = Higher Potential Returns) This isn't always the case, though, so don't treat it as a hard rule. While many people fixate on the ceiling of the returns, less people consider how much they will lose if things go wrong. This is a very important thing to keep in mind, because even if you are confident in the success of your investment, there is always the potential of unexpected factors.</h3>
		<h3>One common strategy for investments is to diversify your portfolio. What this means in practice is that you're spreading your investments out between many different forms, companies, regions, etc. The benefit of this strategy is that if one of your investments fails, you still have others to rely on, and you don't lose everything. Another advantage is that if there is one of your investments failing indicates a shift in the economy that may ruin your other investments, you have the opportunity to withdraw the others before you start losing value. Alternatively, if you invest a lot of money into one or even two entities and things go wrong, you might not be able to recover from the loss.</h3>
