        <p>This website was established in order to introduce you to or otherwise remind you about some of the basics of finance and investment. This site is meant to be understandable and accessible to anyone regardless of their starting point, so don't feel afraid to dive in. The main purpose of this site was for people to become interested in economics, but even if you aren't interested, it would still do you well to read up on these topics since you'll most likely be confronted with loads of investment opportunities in your lifetime. In any case, I hope you learn at least something new and enjoy your time here. Thanks.</p>
