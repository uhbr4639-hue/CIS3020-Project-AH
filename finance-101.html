        <h3>On this page, I'll be explaining the basics of finance, specifically concepts like debt, budget, and taxes. If you haven't checked out the <a href="keyterms.html">key terms page</a> or the quiz on it yet, I'd highly recommend that you do so, as I'll be assuming you already understand those terms. Now, let's get started.</h3>
        <br>
		<h2>Debt</h2>
		<h3>Financial debt refers to the societal obligation for people who borrow money from lenders to pay back that money in the future, almost always with interest, which is an extra fee that usually scales with time. If this debt is not repayed, there4 will be severe consequences for the borrowers. Being in debt, by itself, comes with many inherent disadvantages like building interest, damage to credit score, and asset seizure, so it is always ideal to avoid any type of debt if possible.</h3>
		<h2>Budget</h2>
		<h3>A budget is a plan to restrict spending to suit your income and needs. The main idea of budgeting is to prevent overspending and also to allow consistent saving for your goals. Typically, budgets are based around every month or, sometimes, every year.</h3>
        <h2>Taxes</h2>
		<h3>Taxes are a financial contribution entities are made to pay the government for the sake of public institutions and the betterment of society. For income tax, it is paid on earnings, which generally increases based on the amount earned. Taxes must also be collected from the sale of goods and imposed on property and assets. There is a portion of your income called taxable income that contains the part of your income that is affected by taxes after accounting for deductions and exemptions. Learning about how taxes work and what can be taxed is very important to know when considering savings, investments, and your financial goals as a whole.</h3>
